# Lasso-MovingAverage-vs-LongOnly-
Use LASSO to take long or short position and compare stats vs long only position. This uses 3m,6m,9m and 12m moving average to predict next day return and take long or short positions based on that. The data is backtested to compare Lasso based position to long only position and check the sharpe ration and maxdrawdown. (excludes any transaction cost analysis)
